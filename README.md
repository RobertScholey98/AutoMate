# TO THE GECKO TEAM

This project is very much an early-stage WIP MVP. 99% of my work is currently in Betways github but there's some cool stuff here to discuss even if it is currently very chaotic üòµ‚Äçüí´.





# AutoMate

A native mobile application to help people take better care of their cars by keeping a record of their car service history and notifying them when/what services are due. 

Future possibilities include:
- Analytics based on registered service histories to predict likely non service-item failure points and proactively recommend inspection/preventative maintenance based on the users exact car/age&mileage.
- opening requests for mechanics to action (making the booking of mechanics easier for customers. You set a date that you're free and they compete for your business without you lifting a finger).
- Showing customers how to do the service and providing a link to where they can buy the parts (requires a couple of brand deals/partnerships (haynes, gsfCarParts) to be viable without relying on user-inputted information being correct).
