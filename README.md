# AutoMate

A native mobile application to help people take better care of their cars by keeping a record of their car service history and notifying them when/what services are due. 

Future possibilities include:
- opening requests for mechanics to action (making the booking of mechanics easier/cheaper for customers)
- Showing customers how to do the service and providing a link to where they can buy the parts (requires a couple of brand deals/partnerships to be viable without relying on user inputted information being correct).
